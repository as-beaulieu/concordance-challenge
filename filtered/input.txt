About The Company

Ambient combines a decade of operational experience with design and engineering prowess to improve apartment living and management in the most impactful, cost-effective way possible.

The name "Ambient" embodies our vision to create a category-defining platform that seamlessly integrates smart technology into the built environment and transforms the way people live, visit, and work in multifamily communities. Our focus is on increasing the value of multifamily properties by making them more efficient to operate and more comfortable to live in.

Overview

We’re looking for an Engineering Manager to lead the Resident Team at Ambient — the team responsible for the software that powers how residents interact with smart devices in their homes. From locks and thermostats to light switches, the work your team does will directly shape the everyday experience of residents in Ambient-powered communities.

This is a high-impact role for a hands-on leader who combines deep technical expertise with strong people management skills. You’ll be responsible for mentoring engineers across multiple disciplines, guiding architectural decisions, and ensuring execution stays aligned with product goals. You’ll also act as a connective force across product, design, quality, and operations to keep projects on track and communication clear.

We value strategic thinkers and creative problem solvers — leaders who can work through ambiguity while elevating both the people and the systems they manage. If you’re excited to lead a mission-critical team at the intersection of software and devices, we’d love to hear from you.
